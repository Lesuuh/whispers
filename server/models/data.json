    "content": "Sometimes, it feels like waking up in Nigeria is an act of courage. You open your eyes, pick up your phone, and before the day even begins, you’re greeted by bad news — fuel prices have gone up again, the power grid has collapsed again, or someone somewhere has looted funds meant for the people. It’s like a cycle that never ends.\n\nI remember growing up and hearing people say, “Things will get better.” But I’m grown now, and it seems like that promise has been postponed indefinitely. Every generation seems to inherit the same problems — unemployment, poor infrastructure, insecurity, and leaders who treat the nation like a personal business. Sometimes I wonder if we’re cursed to keep repeating history.\n\nAnd it’s not just Nigeria. You look around the world, and everywhere you turn, it feels like something is broken. Wars that make no sense, greed disguised as politics, climate change warnings being ignored while billionaires race to space. The world is moving fast, but it’s hard to tell if we’re moving forward or in circles.\n\nIn Nigeria, the smallest things have become luxuries. Constant light feels like a miracle, affordable food feels like a dream, and safety feels like a privilege. Young people are trying their best — tech bros, content creators, small business owners — everyone hustling, trying to create something from nothing. But sometimes, it feels like the system is designed to drain your energy before your dreams even stand a chance.\n\nStill, in the middle of all this chaos, we find laughter. Nigerians will joke about anything — even the hardest realities. It’s both our greatest strength and our biggest weakness. We laugh so we don’t cry. We adapt so well that we forget we deserve better.\n\nI don’t have the answers. I’m just tired — tired of bad governance, tired of promises that never come true, tired of watching potential waste away. But deep down, I still believe something can change. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday. Because if there’s one thing Nigerians have never lost, it’s hope — that stubborn belief that somehow, we’ll rise above it all.",

    "content": "After my last post, someone messaged me saying, “You sound tired.”\nAnd honestly, they were right. I was. But after sitting with my thoughts for a while, I realized something — maybe the reason I get frustrated about Nigeria and the world is because I still care. Deeply.\n\nIt’s easy to give up. It’s easy to shrug and say, “That’s just how things are.” But the truth is, change never starts with people who have accepted defeat. It starts with the ones who still complain, who still dream, who still believe there’s something worth fighting for.\n\nEvery day I look around and see people building something out of nothing — young Nigerians coding at midnight because they can’t afford to waste daylight on poor power supply; photographers walking miles just to capture the perfect shot; students learning new skills online because they refuse to be limited by their environment. That’s the kind of resilience that gives me hope.\n\nYes, the system is broken. But we are not.\nWe are the proof that even in a country that sometimes forgets its people, the people have not forgotten themselves.\n\nThe world may be unfair, but I’ve learned that light still finds a way to shine through the cracks — whether it’s in the kindness of a stranger, the laughter of friends, or the determination of a generation that refuses to be silent.\n\nSo, I’m choosing hope again. Not blind optimism, but a steady kind — the kind that builds, learns, creates, and refuses to quit.\nBecause maybe the light we keep waiting for isn’t coming from the government or the world.\nMaybe it’s coming from us.",

    "category": "Thoughts",
    "content": "Everyone tells you that college is the golden ticket to success. But is it really?\nMillions of students graduate with mountains of debt, only to find themselves in jobs that don’t pay enough to cover their loans.\nMeanwhile, self-taught programmers, digital entrepreneurs, and bootcamp grads are thriving — often without ever stepping foot in a lecture hall.\n\nThe problem isn’t learning — it’s the system. Universities have become businesses that sell certificates, not skills.\nYou’re paying tens of thousands for a degree that doesn’t guarantee employment or real-world readiness.\n\nThink about it: in the digital age, resources to learn anything for free or cheaply are everywhere. YouTube tutorials, online courses, communities, even AI mentors — yet we still pay for outdated programs.\n\nHere’s the kicker: by the time you graduate, your peers who skipped college might already have businesses, portfolios, or multiple income streams.\nCollege isn’t inherently bad — but blindly following the “traditional path” could cost you your most productive years.\n\nSo, here’s the question: is college worth it, or is it just a socially accepted trap that keeps us in debt and dependent on a system that no longer works?\n\nShare your thoughts. Are you a believer in degrees, or have you found a better way to succeed?",
